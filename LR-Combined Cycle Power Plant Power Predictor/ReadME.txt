In this repository I create a Multivarte Regression Model using features, hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP),
Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of a Power Plant. The dataset contains 9568 
data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011). The goal as to farmarilze myself with Regressions models,
Training, testing, splitting and visualize real world data.
