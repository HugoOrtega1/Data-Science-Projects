This is my first competition submission, where i put together what i have learned about logit models to predict which passengers aboard the titanic 
survived the shipwreck or not. I came into the competition knowing the sex, age, and ticket class contributed to whether a person survived or not, so i 
jumped straight into processing the data to fit the model.
