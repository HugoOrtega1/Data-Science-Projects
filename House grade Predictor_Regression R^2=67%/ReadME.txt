In this repository I create a Multivarte Regression Model using a dataset containing house sale prices for King County, 
which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. The dataset is checked for null and missing values then,
I utilize features selection and create a heatmap to find a depedent variable with a number of correlations of .65 and higher.The
goal was to see what can be found with a dataset that usually used to make price predictions. The data is then split 
and put through a scaled to fit the multivarite regression. The R^2 score is 67%
